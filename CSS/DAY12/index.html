          <p>To see a World in a Grain of Sand
               And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
               Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
               And Eternity in an hour.
               
               A Robin Red breast in a Cage
               Puts all Heaven in a Rage.
               A dove house fill'd with doves & Pigeons
               Shudders Hell thro' all its regions.
               A dog starv'd at his Master's Gate
               Predicts the ruin of the State.
               A Horse misus'd upon the Road
               Calls to Heaven for Human blood.
               Each outcry of the hunted Hare
               A fibre from the Brain does tear.
               A Skylark wounded in the wing,
               A Cherubim does cease to sing.
               The Game Cock clipp'd and arm'd for fight
               Does the Rising Sun affright.
               Every Wolf's & Lion's howl
               Raises from Hell a Human Soul.
               The wild deer, wand'ring here & there,
               Keeps the Human Soul from Care.
               The Lamb misus'd breeds public strife
               And yet forgives the Butcher's Knife.
               The Bat that flits at close of Eve
               Has left the Brain that won't believe.
               The Owl that calls upon the Night
               Speaks the Unbeliever's fright.
               He who shall hurt the little Wren
               Shall never be belov'd by Men.
               He who the Ox to wrath has mov'd
               Shall never be by Woman lov'd.
               The wanton Boy that kills the Fly
               Shall feel the Spider's enmity.
               He who torments the Chafer's sprite
               Weaves a Bower in endless Night.
               The Catterpillar on the Leaf
               Repeats to thee thy Mother's grief.
               Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly,
               For the Last Judgement draweth nigh.
               He who shall train the Horse to War
               Shall never pass the Polar Bar.
               The Beggar's Dog & Widow's Cat,
               Feed them & thou wilt grow fat.
               The Gnat that sings his Summer's song
               Poison gets from Slander's tongue.
               The poison of the Snake & Newt
               Is the sweat of Envy's Foot.
               The poison of the Honey Bee
               Is the Artist's Jealousy.
               The Prince's Robes & Beggars' Rags
               Are Toadstools on the Miser's Bags.
               A truth that's told with bad intent
               Beats all the Lies you can invent.
               It is right it should be so;
               Man was made for Joy & Woe;
               And when this we rightly know
               Thro' the World we safely go.
               Joy & Woe are woven fine,
               A Clothing for the Soul divine;
               Under every grief & pine
               Runs a joy with silken twine.
               The Babe is more than swadling Bands;
               Throughout all these Human Lands
               Tools were made, & born were hands,
               Every Farmer Understands.
               Every Tear from Every Eye
               Becomes a Babe in Eternity.
               This is caught by Females bright
               And return'd to its own delight.
               The Bleat, the Bark, Bellow & Roar
               Are Waves that Beat on Heaven's Shore.
               The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath
               Writes Revenge in realms of death.
               The Beggar's Rags, fluttering in Air,
               Does to Rags the Heavens tear.
               The Soldier arm'd with Sword & Gun,
               Palsied strikes the Summer's Sun.
               The poor Man's Farthing is worth more
               Than all the Gold on Afric's Shore.
               One Mite wrung from the Labrer's hands
               Shall buy & sell the Miser's lands:
               Or, if protected from on high,
               Does that whole Nation sell & buy.
               He who mocks the Infant's Faith
               Shall be mock'd in Age & Death.
               He who shall teach the Child to Doubt
               The rotting Grave shall ne'er get out.
               He who respects the Infant's faith
               Triumph's over Hell & Death.
               The Child's Toys & the Old Man's Reasons
               Are the Fruits of the Two seasons.
               The Questioner, who sits so sly,
               Shall never know how to Reply.
               He who replies to words of Doubt
               Doth put the Light of Knowledge out.
               The Strongest Poison ever known
               Came from Caesar's Laurel Crown.
               Nought can deform the Human Race
               Like the Armour's iron brace.
               When Gold & Gems adorn the Plow
               To peaceful Arts shall Envy Bow.
               A Riddle or the Cricket's Cry
               Is to Doubt a fit Reply.
               The Emmet's Inch & Eagle's Mile
               Make Lame Philosophy to smile.
               He who Doubts from what he sees
               Will ne'er believe, do what you Please.
               If the Sun & Moon should doubt
               They'd immediately Go out.
               To be in a Passion you Good may do,
               But no Good if a Passion is in you.
               The Whore & Gambler, by the State
               Licenc'd, build that Nation's Fate.
               The Harlot's cry from Street to Street
               Shall weave Old England's winding Sheet.
               The Winner's Shout, the Loser's Curse,
               Dance before dead England's Hearse.
               Every Night & every Morn
               Some to Misery are Born.
               Every Morn & every Night
               Some are Born to sweet Delight.
               Some ar Born to sweet Delight,
               Some are born to Endless Night.
               We are led to Believe a Lie
               When we see not Thro' the Eye
               Which was Born in a Night to Perish in a Night
               When the Soul Slept in Beams of Light.
               God Appears & God is Light
               To those poor Souls who dwell in the Night,
               But does a Human Form Display
               To those who Dwell in Realms of day.
               To see a World in a Grain of Sand
               And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
