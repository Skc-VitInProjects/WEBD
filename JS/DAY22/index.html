     <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
     <p id="description">
          In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting for
          a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books,
          and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw
          Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in comic books

          In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great
          influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was inspired by
          seeing a spider climb up a wallâ€”adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become
          unsure of whether or not this is true. Besides the name, the Spider was wanted by both the law and the
          criminal underworld (a defining theme of Spider-Man's early years) and had through years of ceaseless struggle
          developed a "sixth sense", which warns him of danger, the inspiration for Spider-Man's "spider-sense".
